# Divya Quran (Telugu)
I have developed the Divya Quran Telugu app using React Native and Expo. The app provides
Quranic verses with Telugu translations, a customizable Surah list, and detailed verse navigation
with audio playback. It features a user-friendly Drawer Menu, a logo designed in Figma, and cards
for viewing Surahs and downloading audio files. The Share App screen allows users to share via
WhatsApp and email, with a link for feedback and ratings on the Play Store. Designed with
accessibility in mind, the app enhances the Quran reading experience for Telugu-speaking users.
More Versions Will be pending it will be release in the future.

**Technologies Used:** React Native, Expo Cli, Android Studio, JSON, TypeScript, Play Console.
